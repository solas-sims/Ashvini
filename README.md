# **Ashvini** galaxy formation and evolution model

Repo for the **Ashvini** galaxy formation and evolution model, a lightweight Python package for simulating galaxy formation and evolution in a cosmological context.

The model works by balancing the mass fluxes between the baryonic components of galaxies -- gas, stars, dust, and (optionally) a central black hole -- along dark matter halo merger histories. Given a halo's merger history, **Ashvini** models:

1. Star formation rate
1. Gas mass and gas-phase metallicity
1. Stellar mass and stellar metallicity
1. Dust mass
1. Black hole mass (seeding + Eddington-limited growth + AGN feedback)

See [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for the exact governing equations behind each of these and a full parameter reference (every `run_params.yaml` key, its default, and what it physically controls).

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Anand-JM97/Ashvini.git
cd Ashvini
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Required packages (all pip-installable): `numpy`, `scipy`, `astropy`, `h5py`, `pyyaml`.

For running the test suite, also install the dev requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Usage

Configure a run by editing `run_params.yaml` (star formation efficiency, supernova feedback type/timing, reionization, metal yields, dust, black hole growth/seeding/AGN feedback -- see the comments in the file for each section), then run:

```
python3 run.py
```

This integrates every halo in the input merger-tree file and writes the results to an HDF5 file under `data/outputs/`.

### Input halo merger trees

**Ashvini** needs halo merger histories as input. You can download a merger tree file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAiONNCOHSAw829n3zbR1izsIU6JNCO4/view?usp=sharing). This consists of merger histories of 100 haloes in each mass bin, where the bins are linearly distributed within $10^6\leq M_{\rm h}/M_\odot \leq 10^{11}$ at $z=5$.

Merger trees can also be generated directly with [foraois](https://github.com/doctorcbpower/foraois) (the renamed, actively-maintained successor to the `pymctrees` package this script and the notebook below are still named after -- see `ashvini/pymctrees_adapter.py`'s own note) and adapted to Ashvini's expected HDF5 layout with `scripts/build_trees_from_pymctrees.py`:

```
pip install -e /path/to/foraois[camb]   # foraois is not an Ashvini dependency
python scripts/build_trees_from_pymctrees.py \
    /path/to/foraois/config/planck2018.yml \
    data/inputs/merger_trees_pymctrees.h5 \
    --mass-bins 1e6 1e7 1e8 1e9 1e10 1e11 --n-halos 100 --z0 5.0 --z-max 20.0
```

See the script's docstring for the unit/ordering conversions it handles (pymctrees works in Msun/h and grows trees backward from z0; Ashvini expects plain Msun in forward chronological order).

Alternatively, `run()` can generate trees live -- no intermediate file -- by setting `basics.tree_source: pymctrees` in `run_params.yaml` instead of `file` (see the commented-out example in `run_params.yaml` for the full `basics.pymctrees` block: config path, halo count, z0/z_max/dz, mass resolution, backend, seed). Tree generation is fast enough that there's no caching -- every run regenerates the forest. For a forest you want to reuse across many `run_params.yaml` sweeps, build one offline instead with the script above and point `tree_file` at it.

## Package structure

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Drives the integration: `run1()` (vectorised, fast path), `run1_scalar()` (solve_ivp reference), `run_forest()` (all haloes at once), `run()` (CLI entry point, reads or generates trees, writes HDF5) |
| `run_params.py` / `run_params.yaml` | Dataclass-based config loader |
| `pymctrees_adapter.py` | pymctrees <-> Ashvini tree-format conversion (unit/ordering conversions, pre-formation-prefix handling), shared by `scripts/build_trees_from_pymctrees.py` (offline) and `run()`'s live `tree_source: pymctrees` path |
| `gas_evolve.py` | Cosmological gas accretion and the gas-mass reservoir ODE |
| `star_formation.py` | Star formation rate |
| `metallicity.py` | Gas-phase and stellar metal enrichment |
| `dust.py` | Dust mass evolution |
| `supernovae_feedback.py` | Mass-loaded supernova winds |
| `black_holes_growth.py` | BH seeding (three configurable channels) and Eddington-limited growth (`black_holes.eddington_multiplier` allows super-Eddington); default `growth_model: "pznk11_freefall"` |
| `black_holes_growth_slimdisk.py` | Alternative BH growth model (`growth_model: "hobbs_slimdisk"`): enclosed-mass free-fall accretion, graded `r_crit` super-Eddington cap, King (2003) energy-driven feedback -- see MODELS.md |
| `spin.py` | BH spin -> radiative efficiency (Novikov-Thorne ISCO relation), used by `black_holes_growth_slimdisk.py` |
| `seed_mass_function.py` | Converts a critical-seed-mass boundary curve into predicted boosted-fractions for standard seed-formation channels |
| `agn_feedback.py` | AGN-driven gas wind, proportional to BH accretion rate |
| `reionization.py` | UV background suppression of gas accretion |
| `utils.py` | Merger-tree I/O, cosmic time/redshift interpolation |
| `critical_seed.py` | General-purpose bisection for the black-hole seed mass at which strict Eddington-limited growth reaches a target overmassiveness (`M_BH(z_anchor) = f_bh*M_star(z_anchor)`), against `main.run_forest()`; vectorised across an ensemble of haloes/trees, one independent bisection per halo |
| `reservoir_stock.py` | The Minimal Viable Model (MVM) of the galaxy and nuclear reservoirs: the model implementation behind the 2026 paper "Critical seed masses for massive black holes in the early Universe". **Frozen**; see the section below and `docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md` |
| `reservoir_stock_premvm.py` | Frozen exploratory model that preceded the MVM; a reference only, not used for any result of the paper |
| `paper_reservoir.py` | Halo-growth-rate (GRUMPY-style spline), UV and cold/hot suppression, virial-quantity and tree-interpolation helpers imported by `reservoir_stock.py`. Its own reservoir integrator (`run_reservoir_paper`, the earlier "Differential Growth" model) is **superseded** by `reservoir_stock.py` and is kept for the record |

## Reproducing figures

`scripts/shmr_dm_model_comparison.py` generates the `foraois` software-release
paper's `ashvini_shmr_dm_models` figure (the $z=0$ stellar-to-halo mass
relation for CDM/WDM/FDM) -- Ashvini's own contribution to that paper, run
against `foraois`-generated trees via `pymctrees_adapter.build_forest_live`
(an editable install of `foraois`, not `pymctrees`). SIDM is not included:
`foraois` has no collapse barrier implemented, or even scoped, for it.

```
python scripts/shmr_dm_model_comparison.py
```

Uses `dz=0.01`, `M_res=1e-5*M0`, `z_max=30` -- not arbitrary choices, see
`docs/RESOLUTION_CONVERGENCE.md` for the dedicated convergence study
behind them (and why `foraois`'s own default `dz`/`M_res`/`z_max` values
are *not* adequate for a low-halo-mass SHMR). That investigation's own
supporting scripts are also here, each independently runnable and each
producing the diagnostic figure `docs/RESOLUTION_CONVERGENCE.md` walks
through:

| Script | Produces |
|---|---|
| `scripts/stellar_to_halo_mass_relation.py` | The base SHMR (single dark-matter model), with `--`-free BH-growth-on/off and UVB/reionization-on/off toggles baked in as script constants -- the exploratory precursor to `shmr_dm_model_comparison.py` above |
| `scripts/resolution_timestep_sensitivity.py` | One-parameter-at-a-time `dz`/`M_res` sensitivity scan (superseded by the joint scan below, kept for the record of how the `dz`-vs-`M_res` confound was first found) |
| `scripts/joint_resolution_convergence.py` | The joint `dz` x `M_res` grid that resolved that confound |
| `scripts/formation_redshift_vs_resolution.py` | Halo formation-redshift vs. `M_res`, used to rule out a `z_max`-truncation artifact as the explanation for `M_star`'s continued growth with finer `M_res` |
| `scripts/zh_vs_pch08_mres_scan.py` | Same baryonic model on PCH08 and Zhang-Hui trees over `M_res/M0` = 1e-2 to 1e-5; shows the `M_res` trend in `M_star` comes from PCH08 at small `M_res/M0`, not from Ashvini |
| `scripts/reionization_gamma_omega_sensitivity.py` | Sensitivity of the low-mass SHMR to the Okamoto et al. (2008) reionization-suppression shape parameters (`gamma`, `omega`) -- a separate question from the `dz`/`M_res` convergence study above |

None of these six scripts are used by the paper directly (only
`shmr_dm_model_comparison.py` is); they're the reproducibility trail for
*why* that script's settings are what they are.

## The MVM and the frozen production calculation

`ashvini/reservoir_stock.py` implements the paper's model (module docstring: halo supply, the angular-momentum criterion for delivering galaxy gas to a nuclear reservoir, coupled black-hole and star-formation sinks with stellar and AGN feedback, and the critical-seed diagnostic). Its equations are summarised in [`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md).

The production calculation (13 halo masses, 240 Zhang and Hui trees per mass, 801 time nodes, `dz = 0.05`, `M_res = 1e4 Msun`, `z = 25` to `5`) is **frozen**. Its output is `scripts/paper_figures/output/mvm_production_results.json`, produced with `reservoir_stock.py` (SHA-256 beginning `31c701dd`, first recorded in Ashvini commit `695b114`, which was made after the run) and a recorded, partly inferred state of `foraois`. [`docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md) records what generated it (marking what is inferred and what is not established), what later changes do and do not affect, and what is not exactly reproducible (the numba tree sampler is not seed-reproducible, so a rerun gives a new ensemble; the JSON is the record). **A `foraois v0.1.2` numerical-validity correction (2026-09-22) has been applied to this run** -- the compiled tree kernel's `sigma(M)` table clamp and `pk_kmax=100` both silently degraded `M_res` at the low end this production used. The full 13-mass ensemble has been regenerated with the fix; the original frozen file is preserved as `mvm_production_results_pre_v0.1.2_kmax_fix.json`. See `docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md`'s section 9 for the corrected values (critical-seed medians shift by $+0.3$ to $+4.7\%$ across all thirteen masses; first-resolved-node quantities shift substantially -- the median first-resolved redshift is now $24.8$ at every mass).

Two limitations to know about:

* **Timestep compliance of the production trees.** The Zhang and Hui builder registers at most one split per step, and `dz = 0.05` at `M_res = 1e4 Msun` is far outside the practical single-split criterion (expected splits per step of about 0.1 or less; `foraois` `docs/PCH08_HIGH_Z_DIAGNOSTIC.md`). The trees are therefore not timestep-converged, and the effect on the black-hole calculation has not been quantified. The manuscript states this.
* **Path dependency.** The scripts under `scripts/paper_figures/` (production generator and diagnostics) need the environment variable `FORAOIS_ROOT`, the directory of a `foraois` checkout containing `src/` and `config/`.

What is what under `scripts/paper_figures/`:

| Kind | Where |
|---|---|
| Production output and the figures derived from it | `output/mvm_production_results.json`, `plot_mvm_fig1_boundary.py`, `plot_mvm_fig2_inverse.py`, `plot_mvm_fig3_hostbaryons.py`, `mvm_crib_numbers.py` |
| Diagnostics and stress tests behind the manuscript (own tree ensembles; the logs are the record) | `diagnostics/` (see its `README.md`), `diagnostics/logs/`; `plot_c18_*.py` |
| Superseded exploratory and earlier-manuscript material | listed in `scripts/paper_figures/SUPERSEDED.md`; kept for the record, not used for any result of the current paper |

Numbers, claims and their sources are organised in `docs/mvm_numerical_crib_sheet.md` and `docs/mvm_claim_map.md`. Run the tests with `python -m pytest tests`.

## Interactive exploration

`notebooks/pymctrees_ashvini_demo.ipynb` demonstrates the live pymctrees hook end to end:

1. Generates trees for a few z=5 mass bins and runs Ashvini under delayed vs. instantaneous supernova feedback (default parameters otherwise) -- the bursty, oscillatory gas-mass signature delayed feedback is meant to produce (and its absence under instantaneous feedback) is directly visible, most strongly at the low-mass end.
2. Verifies BH growth and feedback directly: seeding events, the Eddington-limited growth cap (`black_holes.eddington_multiplier`), and a sanity check that growth never exceeds it.
3. Samples a much wider, denser mass range (24 log-spaced points, 1e7-1e11 Msun) and compares stellar/gas mass growth with vs. without BH growth and feedback (seeding disabled entirely) -- the same competitive-gas-budget mechanism `tests/test_bh_growth_feedback.py` checks as a unit test.
4. Shows how to systematically swap the underlying dark matter model (CDM/WDM/FDM/FDM+sharp-k, by pointing `PYMCTREES_CONFIG` at a different pymctrees config file), with a worked CDM-vs-FDM comparison.

Open it with `jupyter notebook notebooks/pymctrees_ashvini_demo.ipynb` after `pip install -e /path/to/foraois[camb] jupyter`.

### Numerical scheme

`run1()`/`run_forest()` integrate the five baryonic ODEs (gas mass, gas metals, stellar mass, stellar metals, dust mass) and the BH-mass ODE using closed-form/quadrature updates rather than `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, and vectorise the integration across every halo in a forest simultaneously (they all share the same redshift grid). `run1_scalar()` retains the original per-halo, per-timestep `solve_ivp` integration as a trusted reference for validating the fast path -- see the module-level comments in `main.py` for the numerical details, and `tests/test_run1.py` for the cross-validation.

## Testing

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/
```

The suite runs against a small downsampled merger-tree fixture (`tests/fixtures/merger_trees_fixture.h5`, regenerated with `scripts/downsample_trees.py`) and checks output shapes/validity, a pinned reference baseline, agreement between the vectorised and reference integrators, and BH seeding/growth invariants. `test_run_params.py` and `test_run_tree_source.py` cover the `tree_source: pymctrees` config parsing (including a regression test for `run_params.yaml`'s bare-exponent-number YAML gotcha, e.g. `1e10` parsing as a string) and a full live-generation `run()` smoke test; both are skipped if pymctrees isn't installed. `test_bh_growth_feedback.py` covers BH accretion as a genuine gas-mass sink (competing with star formation for the same budget), the Eddington-growth multiplier, and the (optionally delayed) AGN wind term.
