"""
Tests for ashvini.pymctrees_adapter -- the adapter that turns a pymctrees
forest into ashvini.utils.read_trees' expected layout, shared by the
offline scripts/build_trees_from_pymctrees.py path and the live
tree_source='pymctrees' path (see main.py's run()).

pymctrees is not an Ashvini dependency (see the module's own docstring), so
these tests are skipped entirely if it isn't installed. They use a synthetic
power-law P(k) (mirroring pymctrees' own test suite) rather than CLASS/CAMB,
so they don't require either heavy backend to be installed either -- only
pymctrees itself.
