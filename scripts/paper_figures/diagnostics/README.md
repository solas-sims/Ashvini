# MVM diagnostics (2026-09-20)

Scripts and logs behind the numbers in `docs/mvm_numerical_crib_sheet.md` that do **not** come from the
production ensemble (`output/mvm_production_results.json`). The merger-tree sampler (numba backend) is not
seed-reproducible, so every log is the record of its own tree ensemble; two logs of "the same" experiment
differ by sampling noise (about 1 to 2 per cent in a 60-tree median). All runs use the frozen MVM
(`ashvini/reservoir_stock.py`) at the fiducial parameters unless the script varies them, and f_BH = 0.5.

| `c19_timestep_compliance.py` | `c19_timestep_compliance` | 6 independent sets of 100 (3e10) or 60 (3e11, 3e13) trees per setting, 801-step dt | tree-builder timestep compliance: trees at dz = 0.05/k recorded at the production dz = 0.05 checkpoints; effect on M_seed,crit |
| `c17_pch08_check*.py` | `c17_pch08_check` | 40 to 60 | why PCH08 cannot be used here (near-deterministic, too-early main-progenitor history at small M_res) |

All scripts here and `gen_mvm_production.py` locate `foraois` through the environment variable `FORAOIS_ROOT` (a checkout containing `src/` and `config/`); see `docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md` for the state used for the production ensemble and for what is not exactly reproducible.

`c17_*` diagnostics assert that `reservoir_stock.py` has the hash recorded in the production JSON, so they branch from the frozen commit.
`logs/c17_trees.log` reports the PCH08 comparison run **as it was run**; it is not a valid result (see the PCH08 evidence in the crib sheet, C17).

`c18_*` scripts and `c19_timestep_compliance.py` assert the frozen module hash as well. The all-delivered control replaces `nuclear_transfer` at run time and restores it; the frozen file is not edited.
Data and figures: `output/c19_timestep_compliance_results.json`, `output/c18_*.json`, `output/sat_fig1` to `sat_fig8` (`plot_c18_saturation.py`, `plot_c18_test4_phase.py`, `plot_c18_eta_eps.py`).

Vocabulary: the manuscript calls the fraction of galaxy gas that reaches the nucleus "nuclear delivery" (earlier drafts and some records say "accessibility"). Prose, printed labels and plot legends here use "delivery". Code identifiers and stored records keep the earlier word so that provenance references stay valid: the script and log names `c17_accessibility_reach.*` and `sat_fig5_all_accessible.*`, the frozen production JSON keys `accessible_R250` and `accessibility_experiment`, `gen_mvm_production.py`, `ashvini/reservoir_stock.py` (hash asserted), and the existing logs (which were written with the earlier labels).

Caveats on individual logs:

* `premvm_vs_mvm_20trees.log`: the line "wind cap ... steps with gas" uses a wrong denominator (steps with gas at the
  start of the step) and can exceed 100 per cent. Use `feedback_limited_by_z_20trees.log`, whose denominator is
  the steps with any feedback demand, or the 801-step figures in `mass_scaling_240trees_*`.
* Diagnostics that scale with the time step (nuclear share of M_star, star formation before z = 10, G_BH - 1,
  the feedback-limited fraction) are resolution-dependent; see `timestep_paired_60trees_*`.
* `regime_*` and `converge_*` logs use fewer trees (20 or 60) than production; quote them for regimes and
  ratios, not as precision values of M_seed,crit.
