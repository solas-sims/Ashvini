# Ashvini: physical models and parameter reference

This document lists the governing equations behind every module in [`ashvini/`](ashvini/) and every parameter that controls them, with defaults as shipped in [`run_params.yaml`](run_params.yaml). For module-to-file mapping and usage, see [README.md](README.md). Line-level detail (exact closed-form solutions used by the vectorised fast path) is in the module docstrings/comments; this document focuses on the physics and the config surface.

Units: masses in Msun, time in Gyr, metallicities in Z_solar units, unless noted. Two different `astropy` cosmologies are used internally: [`utils.py`](ashvini/utils.py) (cosmic time/redshift interpolation, used everywhere) uses **Planck18**; [`reionization.py`](ashvini/reionization.py) uses **Planck15** for its own `H(z)` term. This is a pre-existing inconsistency between modules, not a deliberate modelling choice -- worth knowing if you're chasing small discrepancies in reionization suppression near the LCDM/`H(z)` boundary.

Every reservoir (gas, stars, gas metals, stellar metals, dust, black hole) is evolved as an ODE in cosmic time along a halo's merger history. `main.py` provides two integrators over the same equations: `run1_scalar()` (per-halo, per-timestep `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, kept as a trusted reference) and `run_forest()`/`run1()` (the production path, vectorised across all haloes in a forest, using closed-form/quadrature updates instead of `solve_ivp` -- see [Numerical scheme](#numerical-scheme) at the end). Both solve *exactly* the same equations below; they differ only in how the ODEs are stepped.

## Free-fall time

Used by both star formation and BH growth:

```
t_ff(z) = 0.141 * t_Hubble(z)     [Gyr],   t_Hubble(z) = 1/H(z)
```

## Star formation ([`star_formation.py`](ashvini/star_formation.py))

```
dM_star/dt = SFR(t, M_gas) = (epsilon_ff / t_ff(z(t))) * M_gas
```

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| epsilon_ff | `star_formation.efficiency` | 0.015 | Star formation efficiency per free-fall time |

## Gas reservoir ([`gas_evolve.py`](ashvini/gas_evolve.py))

Cosmological inflow, suppressed by the UV background if enabled:

```
Mdot_gas,inflow(z, M_halo, Mdot_halo) = (Omega_b/Omega_m) * Mdot_halo * S_uv(z, M_halo, Mdot_halo)
```

Gas mass ODE (all baryonic sinks acting on the reservoir):

```
dM_gas/dt = Mdot_acc - SFR(t,M_gas) - eta_w(z,M_halo,Z_star)*SFR_wind - Mdot_BH - Mdot_AGN,wind
```

- `eta_w` is the supernova mass-loading factor ([below](#supernova-feedback-supernovae_feedbackpy)).
- `SFR_wind` is the SFR driving the SN wind, selected by `supernova.type`:
  - `"no"` -> `SFR_wind = 0` (feedback off)
  - `"instantaneous"` -> `SFR_wind = SFR(t, M_gas)` (present-time SFR)
  - `"delayed"` (default) -> `SFR_wind` = the SFR from `supernova.delay_time` Gyr ago
- `Mdot_BH` is instantaneous BH accretion -- gas flowing into the BH leaves the reservoir the moment it's accreted.
- `Mdot_AGN,wind = eta_agn * Mdot_BH_delayed` ([AGN feedback](#agn-feedback-agn_feedbackpy)).

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| UV_background enabled | `reionization.UVB_enabled` | True | Whether inflow is suppressed by the UV background |

## Metal enrichment ([`metallicity.py`](ashvini/metallicity.py))

Gas-phase metal mass, with a separate branch for halos with no gas (pure inflow + delayed-wind enrichment, no dilution term):

```
M_gas = 0:   dM_Z,gas/dt = Z_IGM*Mdot_acc + Z_yield*SFR_wind

M_gas > 0:   dM_Z,gas/dt = Z_IGM*Mdot_acc - M_Z,gas*SFR(t,M_gas)/M_gas + Z_yield*SFR_wind
                            - eta_w(z,M_halo,Z_star) * (M_Z,gas/M_gas) * SFR_wind
```

Stellar metal mass (new stars inherit the gas-phase metal fraction at formation):

```
dM_Z,star/dt = SFR(t,M_gas) * M_Z,gas/M_gas     (0 if M_gas = 0)
```

Stellar metallicity `Z_star = M_Z,star/M_star` (0 if `M_star=0`) feeds back into the mass-loading factor and dust wind-loss below.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z_IGM | `metallicity.Z_IGM` | 1.0e-3 | Metallicity of inflowing IGM gas (Z_solar) |
| Z_yield | `metallicity.Z_yield` | 0.06 | Metal yield per unit (delayed) SFR returned to the ISM |

## Dust ([`dust.py`](ashvini/dust.py))

```
growth_rate      = Y_d * SFR_past
SNe_rate         = Gamma * SFR_past / M_star,past          (0 if M_star,past <= 0)
dust_loading      = 1 - exp(-(M_gas/M_crit)^Alpha)           (saturates to 1 for M_gas >> M_crit)
destruction_rate  = M_swept * SNe_rate * dust_loading
wind_loss         = (M_dust/M_gas) * eta_w(z,M_halo,Z_star) * SFR_past    (0 if M_gas <= 0)

dM_dust/dt = growth_rate - destruction_rate - wind_loss
```

`SFR_past` and `M_star,past` are the SFR and the *stellar mass formed in that single delayed step interval* (not cumulative) from `supernova.delay_time` ago -- this represents the population of young SN progenitors formed at that specific past episode, driving dust destruction now. Both are 0 until enough cosmic time has elapsed to have delay history.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| M_swept | `dust.m_swept` | 1.0e3 Msun | ISM mass swept/destroyed per SN (`= epsilon_d * M_ISM`) |
| Y_d | `dust.dust_yield` | 0.004 | Dust mass produced per unit (delayed) SFR |
| Gamma | `dust.dust_gamma` | 1.3e-4 | SN rate per unit stellar mass formed in the delayed episode |
| Alpha | `dust.dust_alpha` | 8 | Steepness of the destruction-efficiency saturation curve |
| M_crit | `dust.m_crit` | 1.0e5 Msun | Gas-mass scale at which destruction efficiency saturates |

## Supernova feedback ([`supernovae_feedback.py`](ashvini/supernovae_feedback.py))

Metallicity modulation (smooth logistic step from strong feedback at low `Z_star` to weak feedback at high `Z_star`; the step center/width/floor/ceiling below are hard-coded, not exposed in the YAML):

```
f_Z(Z_star) = sigmoid(-(Z_star - 0.1)/0.01) * (0.25 - 1) + 1
```

Mass-loading factor (mass of gas ejected per unit SFR):

```
eta_w(z, M_halo, Z_star) = epsilon_p * pi_fid * (10^11.5 / M_halo)^(1/3) * (9/(1+z))^(1/2) * f_Z(Z_star)
```

`M_halo = 0` (unformed progenitor) returns `eta_w = 0` exactly, avoiding a `1/M_halo` blow-up.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| type | `supernova.type` | `"delayed"` | `"no"` / `"instantaneous"` / `"delayed"` -- which SFR drives the wind (see [gas reservoir](#gas-reservoir-gas_evolvepy)) |
| delay_time | `supernova.delay_time` | 0.015 Gyr | Lookback time for the delayed-feedback SFR |
| epsilon_p | `supernova.epsilon_p` | 5 | Mass-loading normalization |
| pi_fid | `supernova.pi_fid` | 1 | Fiducial mass-loading efficiency multiplier |

## Black hole growth ([`black_holes_growth.py`](ashvini/black_holes_growth.py))

Eddington rate (mass-proportional):

```
Mdot_Edd(M_BH) = kappa * M_BH,   kappa = 4*pi*G*m_p / (sigma_thomson * c)   [consistent Msun/Gyr units]
```

Growth rate, gas-supply-limited but capped at a (possibly super-Eddington) multiple of the Eddington rate:

```
dM_BH/dt = min( (epsilon_BH / t_ff(z)) * M_gas,  f_Edd * kappa * M_BH )
```

**Seeding** -- three independently enable-able channels, checked in priority order (first satisfied wins per halo, using the *previous* step's halo mass/redshift/gas metallicity), only for not-yet-seeded halos:

| Channel | Config block | Condition | Seed mass |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pop III remnant | `black_holes.seeding.pop3` | `z >= z_min` AND `M_halo >= M_halo_min` AND `Z_gas <= Z_gas_max` | `M_seed` |
| Direct collapse | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse` | (as above, checked next) | `M_seed` |
| Halo-mass threshold | `black_holes.seeding.halo_mass_threshold` | `M_halo >= M_halo_min` (fallback) | `M_seed` |

Default values:

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| enabled | `black_holes.seeding.pop3.enabled` | True | Pop III channel on/off |
| z_min | `black_holes.seeding.pop3.z_min` | 15 | Only forms this early in the universe |
| M_halo_min | `black_holes.seeding.pop3.M_halo_min` | 1.0e6 Msun | Minihalo mass threshold (H2-cooling, Tvir ~ 1e4 K) |
| Z_gas_max | `black_holes.seeding.pop3.Z_gas_max` | 1.0e-4 | Near-primordial gas required |
| M_seed | `black_holes.seeding.pop3.M_seed` | 1.0e2 Msun | Light seed (Pop III remnant) |
| enabled | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse.enabled` | True | Direct-collapse channel on/off |
| z_min | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse.z_min` | 10 | Redshift floor |
| M_halo_min | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse.M_halo_min` | 1.0e7 Msun | Atomic-cooling halo threshold |
| Z_gas_max | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse.Z_gas_max` | 1.0e-5 | Pristine gas required to suppress H2 fragmentation |
| M_seed | `black_holes.seeding.direct_collapse.M_seed` | 1.0e5 Msun | Heavy seed |
| enabled | `black_holes.seeding.halo_mass_threshold.enabled` | True | Fallback channel on/off |
| M_halo_min | `black_holes.seeding.halo_mass_threshold.M_halo_min` | 1.0e10 Msun | Generic mass threshold |
| M_seed | `black_holes.seeding.halo_mass_threshold.M_seed` | 1.0e3 Msun | Seed mass |
| efficiency | `black_holes.efficiency` | 0.001 | `epsilon_BH`, gas-supply growth efficiency (same functional form as SF efficiency) |
| eddington_multiplier | `black_holes.eddington_multiplier` | 1.0 | `f_Edd`, Eddington cap multiplier (>1 allows super-Eddington growth) |

## AGN feedback ([`agn_feedback.py`](ashvini/agn_feedback.py), [`black_holes_growth.py`](ashvini/black_holes_growth.py))

```
Mdot_AGN,wind = eta_agn_eff * Mdot_BH,delayed
```

`Mdot_BH,delayed` is the BH growth rate from `feedback_delay_time` Gyr ago (0 if no history yet); with the default `feedback_delay_time = 0.0`, this reduces to the current step's own accretion rate (instantaneous feedback). By default `eta_agn_eff` is just the constant `eta_agn`; enabling `black_holes.sigma_feedback` replaces it with the M-sigma self-regulation coupling below.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| eta_agn | `black_holes.eta_agn` | 0.5 | AGN wind mass-loading efficiency |
| feedback_delay_time | `black_holes.feedback_delay_time` | 0.0 Gyr | Lag between BH accretion and the wind it powers; 0.0 = instantaneous |

### Isothermal-sphere M-sigma self-regulation (optional)

King (2003, 2005) and Power, Zubovas, Nayakshin & King (2011, MNRAS 413, L110) argue AGN wind coupling to bulge gas isn't a constant efficiency: it's weak (momentum-driven, Compton-cooled, effectively trapped near the BH) while `M_BH < M_sigma`, and becomes effective at expelling gas once `M_BH >= M_sigma`, where `M_sigma` is set by balancing the wind's Eddington-limited momentum thrust against the weight of the overlying gas in an isothermal sphere. `black_holes.sigma_feedback.enabled` (default `False`) swaps the constant `eta_agn` above for this mechanism; disabled, behaviour is identical to the constant coupling. Only the isothermal-sphere approximation is implemented -- an NFW version (radius-dependent weight, concentration-mass relation, transcendental `M_sigma` solve) is a deliberate follow-up, not implemented here.

Isothermal-sphere velocity dispersion (`velocity_dispersion`, from the virial relations `R_v = sigma/(5*sqrt(2)*H(z))`, `M_v = 2*sigma^2*R_v/G`, PZNK11 eq. 18):

```
sigma(M_halo, z) = [ (5*sqrt(2)/2) * G * H(z) * M_halo ]^(1/3)
```

`H(z)` uses the same Planck18 cosmology as everywhere else in the package (`utils.Hubble_time`), not a third cosmology alongside the Planck18/Planck15 split noted above. `M_halo <= 0` gives `sigma = 0`.

Self-regulated BH mass scale (`m_sigma`, King 2003/2005, PZNK11 eq. 5):

```
M_sigma(sigma) = (f_g * kappa_es / (pi * G^2)) * sigma^4
```

`kappa_es = sigma_thomson/m_p` is the electron-scattering opacity -- a different quantity from the Eddington-rate constant `kappa` in [Black hole growth](#black-hole-growth-black_holes_growthpy) above, despite the shared name in the literature. `sigma = 0` gives `M_sigma = 0`.

Effective coupling (`coupling_switch`, replacing the constant `eta_agn`):

```
eta_agn_eff(M_BH, M_sigma) = eta_agn * f_switch(M_BH / M_sigma)
f_switch(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-log10(x) / transition_width))     (logistic in log10(M_BH/M_sigma), centered at M_BH = M_sigma)
```

Neither paper specifies a particular smooth interpolation between the trapped and escaping regimes -- only that the regime change happens near `M_BH ~ M_sigma` -- so `f_switch`'s exact functional form is a deliberate modelling choice, isolated in `coupling_switch()` so it can be revisited independently of the rest of the pipeline. `M_BH <= 0` or `M_sigma <= 0` gives `f_switch = 0` (no coupling without a BH, or for an unformed halo).

**Numerical scheme note**: because `eta_agn_eff` depends on `M_BH(t)`, which evolves within the same step as the gas-mass ODE it enters, `M_BH` is evaluated at the step midpoint (via the same closed-form BH-growth update used for `bh_mass[j]` itself, but over `dt/2`) rather than at the step's own not-yet-known end -- consistent with how every other time-varying coefficient in the gas ODE is already frozen mid-step (see [Numerical scheme](#numerical-scheme)), and necessary to keep the gas-mass ODE affine so `_linear_ode_step` still applies exactly.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| enabled | `black_holes.sigma_feedback.enabled` | False | Master switch; disabled reproduces the constant `eta_agn` coupling exactly |
| f_g | `black_holes.sigma_feedback.f_g` | 0.16 | Baryon fraction relative to dark matter |
| kappa_es | `black_holes.sigma_feedback.kappa_es` | null (-> `sigma_thomson/m_p`) | Electron-scattering opacity, cm^2/g |
| transition_width | `black_holes.sigma_feedback.transition_width` | 0.1 | Dex width of the smooth `M_BH/M_sigma` switch |
| growth_cap_enabled | `black_holes.sigma_feedback.growth_cap_enabled` | False | Hard `M_BH` growth cap, see below. Requires `enabled: True` too. |

**Important caveat about `enabled` alone, checked directly (see `tests/test_sigma_feedback.py::test_sigma_feedback_wind_alone_does_not_cap_bh_growth_near_m_sigma`): by itself, this does not hold `M_BH` near `M_sigma`.** "Self-regulation" in King (2003, 2005)/PZNK11 refers to the BH's own growth eventually being throttled once the wind is strong enough to expel/starve the gas supply feeding it -- but `enabled: True` alone only adds a gas-removal *wind* term (`Mdot_wind = eta_agn_eff * Mdot_BH`), not a direct cap on `M_BH` itself. Regulation, if any, can only happen indirectly through the wind depleting `gas_mass` enough to lower the gas-supply-limited growth rate (`epsilon_BH/t_ff * gas_mass`) that feeds `M_BH`. Checked over a long (z=25 -> z=0.5), sustained-accretion integration: that indirect loop is nowhere near strong enough -- cosmological gas resupply vastly outpaces even a maximal wind (`eta_agn=1.0`), so `M_BH` keeps growing over two orders of magnitude past `M_sigma`, not settling near it. `growth_cap_enabled` below (off by default) is what actually closes this gap.

#### Hard growth cap (`growth_cap_enabled`)

PZNK11 do not give an equation for *how* growth halts once `M_BH` approaches `M_sigma` -- in their own words, **"precisely how this last step occurs is still the most unclear part of any theory."** What they do give (eq. 21-22) is a bound on the eventual overshoot, reached once the AGN outflow "presumably halts further accretion" after propagating through the bulge on its dynamical time:

```
ceiling(M_halo, z) = M_sigma * (1 + 0.41 * sigma_200 / h(z))
```

`sigma_200 = sigma(M_halo, z) / (200 km/s)`, `h(z)` the dimensionless Hubble parameter (`utils.h_of_z`). `growth_cap_enabled: True` (`black_holes_growth.growth_ceiling`) applies this as a **hard cutoff**: `dM_BH/dt = 0` once `M_BH >= ceiling`, implemented by clipping each step's growth-update result to the ceiling (exact, not an approximation -- `M_BH` is monotonically non-decreasing in this model, so clipping the endpoint is equivalent to freezing the ODE the instant it would cross the ceiling). Because `ceiling` grows with the halo (via `sigma`), a previously-capped BH can resume growing later if its halo grows enough to raise the ceiling -- this is a deliberate consequence of tying the cap to the halo's own evolving properties, not a bug.

**The hard cutoff itself is a disclosed modelling choice, not an equation read directly off the paper** -- PZNK11 gives the ceiling value, not the transition's functional form. Checked directly (`tests/test_sigma_feedback.py::test_growth_cap_enabled_actually_holds_bh_mass_near_ceiling`): under the same sustained-accretion, maximal-wind conditions where the wind-only mechanism let `M_BH` grow two orders of magnitude past `M_sigma`, the hard cap holds `M_BH` at >90% of its ceiling throughout.

Out of scope for this mechanism (potential follow-ups): an NFW-profile version of `sigma`/`M_sigma`; a smooth (rather than hard-cutoff) transition at the ceiling; and the competing nuclear-cluster feedback channel (Nayakshin, Wilkinson & King 2009).

## Alternative BH growth model: `growth_model: "hobbs_slimdisk"` ([`black_holes_growth_slimdisk.py`](ashvini/black_holes_growth_slimdisk.py), [`spin.py`](ashvini/spin.py))

Selected via `black_holes.growth_model` (default `"pznk11_freefall"`, the
model above -- unchanged). Ported from the 2026 "Differential Growth"
paper's standalone prototype; see
[`docs/2026_paper_session_code_catalogue.md`](docs/2026_paper_session_code_catalogue.md)
for provenance and what was deliberately *not* ported (a stochastic,
time-varying compaction boost -- see below). Genuinely different physics
from the default model above, not a bug-fix relationship -- both are
physically motivated but make different choices; see the catalogue doc's
comparison table.

**Nuclear accretion supply** (Hobbs, Power, Nayakshin & King 2012): a
free-fall estimate on the *total enclosed mass*, not naive Bondi-Hoyle
(`Mdot ~ M_BH^2`), which is the wrong estimator whenever `M_BH` does not
dominate the local enclosed mass -- exactly the light-seed case:

```
t_ff(M_enc) = sqrt(R_nuc^3 / (2*G*M_enc)),   M_enc = M_BH + M_gas + M_star
Mdot_acc = eta_acc * (M_gas / t_ff(M_enc)) * Phi_hat^2
```

`Phi_hat` (`black_holes.slimdisk.compaction_boost`) is a Booth & Schaye
(2009)-style density boost, anchored to Lapiner, Dekel & Dubois (2021)
compaction events. **Simplification versus the paper's own analysis
scripts**: the paper explored a stochastic, time-varying `Phi_hat(t)`
(an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process); that is not reproduced here, since it
doesn't fit this package's "coefficients frozen over a step" closed-form
integration scheme (see [Numerical scheme](#numerical-scheme)) --
`compaction_boost` here is a single fixed multiplier for a given run.

**Radiative efficiency / spin**: exposed as a genuine free parameter
(`black_holes.slimdisk.a_star`, BH spin, mapped to `epsilon` via the
Novikov-Thorne ISCO relation, `spin.epsilon_from_spin`) -- unlike the
default model above, whose Eddington-rate constant has no `epsilon`
dependence at all.

```
kappa_edd = [(1-epsilon)/epsilon] * 4*pi*G*m_p / (sigma_thomson*c)   [1/Gyr]
Mdot_Edd,std(M_BH) = kappa_edd * M_BH
```

**Graded super-Eddington cap** (Watarai et al. 2000; Madau, Haardt &
Dotti 2014; Lupi et al. 2024 slim-disc picture) -- a threshold ratio
`r_crit`, not a hard multiplier applied at every mass:

```
cap(M_BH) = Mdot_Edd,std(M_BH)   if Mdot_acc/Mdot_Edd,std(M_BH) <= r_crit
            Mdot_acc / r_crit    otherwise

dM_BH/dt = min(Mdot_acc, cap(M_BH))
```

With `Mdot_acc` frozen over a step (same pattern as every other
time-varying coefficient in this package), this is a three-regime
piecewise ODE in `M_BH` -- constant (slim-disc-throttled, small `M_BH`),
exponential (standard-Eddington-limited, intermediate `M_BH`), constant
(gas-supply-limited, large `M_BH`) -- solved exactly in closed form by
`bh_growth_step_slimdisk` (crossing times between regimes found
analytically, not approximated), verified against a numerical
`solve_ivp` reference and against the default model's own
`_bh_growth_step` in the limit `r_crit -> infinity` (see
`tests/test_black_holes_growth_slimdisk.py`).

**AGN feedback**: King (2003) energy-driven wind, a direct, constant-`epsilon_f`
coupling (not the default model's `M_BH/M_sigma` logistic switch):

```
Mdot_wind = (2*epsilon_f*c^2 / sigma^2) * Mdot_BH
```

`sigma` reuses the default model's isothermal-sphere `velocity_dispersion(M_halo, z)`.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| growth_model | `black_holes.growth_model` | `"pznk11_freefall"` | `"hobbs_slimdisk"` selects this model instead |
| eta_acc | `black_holes.slimdisk.eta_acc` | 0.01 | Nuclear accretion efficiency |
| R_nuc_pc | `black_holes.slimdisk.R_nuc_pc` | 100.0 | Fixed nuclear radius for the free-fall estimate, pc |
| compaction_boost | `black_holes.slimdisk.compaction_boost` | 1.0 | Fixed `Phi_hat` multiplier (>=1); no time-varying version, see above |
| r_crit | `black_holes.slimdisk.r_crit` | 8.0 | Supply/standard-Eddington ratio threshold for the slim-disc cap |
| epsilon_f | `black_holes.slimdisk.epsilon_f` | 5.0e-4 | King (2003) AGN wind coupling |
| a_star | `black_holes.slimdisk.a_star` | 0.5 | BH spin -> radiative efficiency via `spin.epsilon_from_spin` |

A companion utility, [`seed_mass_function.py`](ashvini/seed_mass_function.py),
converts a critical-seed-mass boundary curve (`M_seed,crit(M_halo)`, the
seed mass below which strict-Eddington growth under this model cannot
reach a target `f_BH` by some anchor redshift -- see the paper) into
predicted boosted-fractions for standard seed-formation channels
(Pop III / runaway-collision / direct-collapse), given illustrative
log-normal-in-log10(mass) population models for each. Not a rigorously
derived population synthesis -- see the module docstring.

## Critical seed mass ([`critical_seed.py`](ashvini/critical_seed.py))

General-purpose companion to `seed_mass_function.py` above: given a halo's
assembly history, finds the black-hole seed mass `M_seed,crit(M_halo)` at
which strict Eddington-limited growth (`growth_model: "hobbs_slimdisk"`,
super-Eddington cap disabled -- see below) reaches a target
overmassiveness by a chosen anchor redshift,

```
M_BH(z_anchor; M_seed,crit) = f_BH * M_star(z_anchor),   f_BH = 0.5 fiducial
```

`M_seed < M_seed,crit` means Eddington-limited growth alone cannot reach
the target by `z_anchor` (a super-Eddington episode, earlier formation, or
a lower effective radiative efficiency would be needed to explain an
observed overmassive black hole); `M_seed >= M_seed,crit` means it can.
This is the light-seed-problem boundary itself, computed directly against
`main.run_forest()` rather than the paper-specific reservoir model of
`paper_reservoir.critical_seed_paper` -- any caller with a halo assembly
history (`halo_mass`, `halo_mass_rate`, `redshift`, the same triple
`build_forest_live`/`build_forest_for_bin` return) can use it, not only
the 2026 paper's own bespoke gas-supply model.

**Strict Eddington-limited growth means `r_crit -> infinity`, not
`r_crit=1`.** `black_holes_growth_slimdisk.bh_growth_step_slimdisk`'s
closed-form update has three regimes with boundaries
`M1=A_bh/(kappa_edd*r_crit)` and `M2=A_bh/kappa_edd=M1*r_crit`; at
`r_crit=1`, `M1=M2` exactly, so the genuine Eddington-limited
(exponential, `kappa_edd`-dependent) regime between them has zero width
and growth equals the raw, uncapped nuclear supply rate `A_bh` at every
black hole mass -- i.e. `r_crit=1` *removes* the Eddington cap entirely,
the opposite of what an earlier version of this module assumed. This was
a real bug (found and fixed 2026-09-15, in both this module and the
sibling `paper_reservoir.critical_seed_paper`, which reimplements the
identical bisection against `paper_reservoir.run_reservoir_paper` instead
of `main.run_forest`): `critical_seed()`'s `r_crit` parameter used to
default to `1.0`, silently computing an *uncapped*-growth seed-mass
boundary while claiming to compute the strict-Eddington one.
`STRICT_EDDINGTON_R_CRIT = 1e12` is now the default, verified directly
against `bh_growth_step_slimdisk` to reproduce pure Eddington-exponential
growth (no crossover into the supply-limited regime) over the seed-mass
range this search brackets. Passing a smaller, finite `r_crit` computes a
*different*, still well-defined quantity -- a seed-mass boundary under a
permitted super-Eddington episode -- just not "M_seed,crit" in the
paper's strict-Eddington sense.

Implementation: vectorised bisection in log-seed-mass, one root per halo,
against `excess(seed_mass) = M_BH(z_anchor) - f_BH*M_star(z_anchor)`.
Well-posed because growth is monotonically non-decreasing in seed mass at
`r_crit=STRICT_EDDINGTON_R_CRIT` (the two-regime closed form is monotonic
in its initial condition), provided AGN feedback's own dependence on seed
mass (via `epsilon_f`) doesn't overwhelm that monotonicity -- true for any
realistic `epsilon_f`, since the AGN wind is a small perturbation on the
gas budget, not a dominant term (see AGN feedback above). Seeding is
injected at each halo's own first-resolved step (not a fixed halo-mass
threshold) by temporarily repointing the existing
`black_holes.seeding.halo_mass_threshold` channel at a per-halo trial
seed-mass array and restoring the original config afterward -- no core
seeding-channel changes were needed for this.

| Parameter | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| f_bh | Target overmassiveness `M_BH(z_anchor)/M_star(z_anchor)` | 0.5 |
| seed_mass_lo, seed_mass_hi | Bisection bracket, Msun | 1.0, 1.0e8 |
| n_iter | Bisection iterations | 50 |
| m_halo_min | Halo-mass floor for the seeding-injection trick above, Msun | 1.0 |
| r_crit | Super-Eddington cap threshold; `STRICT_EDDINGTON_R_CRIT` (1e12) for the paper's strict-Eddington sense | `STRICT_EDDINGTON_R_CRIT` |

Returns `M_seed_crit` (NaN where the bracket doesn't resolve a root: either
`seed_mass_hi` never reaches the target, or `seed_mass_lo` already exceeds
it -- both returned as separate boolean masks so a caller can tell which
failure mode fired and widen the bracket accordingly) plus `**overrides`
(`a_star`, `epsilon_f`, `eta_acc`) forwarded unchanged to `run_forest()`.
Not yet re-exercised against real data since the `r_crit` fix, unlike the
sibling `paper_reservoir.critical_seed_paper`, which was stress-tested
extensively as part of the 2026 paper session (see
`docs/2026_paper_session_code_catalogue.md`) -- callers relying on this
module should re-verify their own results were computed after the fix.

## Reionization ([`reionization.py`](ashvini/reionization.py))

Okamoto et al. (2008)-style suppression of baryonic inflow below a characteristic halo mass `M_c(z)`, active only for `z <= 10` (identically 1, i.e. no suppression, above that):

```
M_c(z) = 1.69e10 * exp(-0.63*z) / (1 + exp((z/beta)^gamma))     [Msun]
beta   = z_reion * ( ln(1.82e3 * exp(-0.63*z_reion) - 1) )^(-1/gamma)

S_uv(z, M_halo, Mdot_halo) = max( 0,
    s(M_halo/M_c(z), omega) * [ (1+X) - 2*epsilon(z)*M_halo*X*(1+z)*H(z)/Mdot_halo ] )

s(x,y)  = (1 + (2^(y/3)-1) * x^-y)^(-3/y)
X       = 3*c_omega*(M_c(z)/M_halo)^omega / (1 + c_omega*(M_c(z)/M_halo)^omega),   c_omega = 2^(omega/3)-1
epsilon(z) = d/dz [ ln(1 + exp((z/beta)^gamma)) ]  (evaluated analytically)
```

`M_halo <= 0` or `Mdot_halo <= 0` (unformed/non-accreting progenitor) forces `S_uv = 0` rather than evaluating the formula (which would otherwise divide by zero).

**Audit note (2026-09-20, [docs/UV_SUPPRESSION_AUDIT.md](docs/UV_SUPPRESSION_AUDIT.md)).** The correction term equals the rate at which the equilibrium gas fraction `s(M/M_c) f_b` falls as `M_c(z)` grows, and inflow cannot go negative, so the term stops accretion rather than removing gas. Measured on Zhang-Hui trees it lets essentially no accretion through after z = 5 for `M_halo < 1e10` and about half at 1e11, and it makes the z = 0 stellar mass depend on the tree time step. The `epsilon(z)` in the code equals `-d ln M_c / d z` for z <= 5 but not above (0.09 of the true value at z = 7, zero for z >= 8); the formula written for `epsilon` above does not match either. `paper_reservoir.uv_suppression_mass_only` (the `s(mu, omega)` factor alone) is the form the MVM uses.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| UVB_enabled | `reionization.UVB_enabled` | True | Master on/off switch |
| z_reion | `reionization.z_reion` | 7 | Reionization redshift |
| gamma | `reionization.gamma` | 15 | Sharpness of the ionization transition |
| omega | `reionization.omega` | 2 | Power-law index of the suppression functional form |

## Merger tree input ([`utils.py`](ashvini/utils.py), [`pymctrees_adapter.py`](ashvini/pymctrees_adapter.py))

Every equation above consumes a halo's mass/growth-rate history along cosmic time, from either an HDF5 file (`basics.tree_source: file`) or a live [pymctrees](https://github.com/doctorcbpower/pymctrees) forest (`basics.tree_source: pymctrees`). See [README.md](README.md#input-halo-merger-trees) for the config surface. Notable conversions in the adapter: pymctrees' Msun/h masses and backward-in-time ordering are converted to plain Msun / forward-chronological; growth rates are finite-differenced against Ashvini's own (Planck18) `time_at_z`, not pymctrees' internal cosmology; and pre-formation placeholder masses (below pymctrees' resolution) are zeroed to represent "halo does not exist yet," which is what the `M_halo <= 0` guards throughout this document are protecting against.

| Parameter | Config key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| tree_source | `basics.tree_source` | `"file"` | `"file"` reads `tree_file`; `"pymctrees"` generates a forest live each run |
| tree_file | `basics.tree_file` | `./data/inputs/merger_trees.h5` | HDF5 merger-tree input (used when `tree_source: file`) |
| mass_bin | `basics.mass_bin` | 1.0e10 Msun | z=5 halo mass bin label, used for output naming and `pymctrees` live generation's default `m_res` |
| dir_out | `basics.dir_out` | `./data/outputs/` | Output directory |

## Minimal Viable Model of the galaxy and nuclear reservoirs ([`reservoir_stock.py`](ashvini/reservoir_stock.py))

The model behind the 2026 paper "Critical seed masses for massive black holes in the early Universe". It is separate from the ODE model above (`main.py`) and is integrated along a halo's main-progenitor history on a uniform cosmic-time grid with an explicit, causally ordered step. **Frozen**; the production calculation and its provenance are in [`docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_PROVENANCE.md). The module docstring is the authoritative statement of what is and is not included.

State: a black hole, two gas reservoirs (galaxy and nuclear), stellar mass at both scales, and a ledger of gas that fails the galaxy criterion. Defaults live in `paper_reservoir_params.yaml`.

* **Halo supply.** `Mdot_in = zeta_UV(M_halo, z) zeta_ch(M_halo) f_b Mdot_halo`, with the Okamoto et al. (2008) step for `zeta_UV` (`z <= 10`) and `zeta_ch = 1 - s(M_halo/M_hot, phi)`, `M_hot = 4e11 Msun`. `Mdot_halo` is a spline-derived rate from the tree history (`paper_reservoir.grumpy_halo_growth_rate`).
* **Delivery.** Each step's inflow is a cohort with `ln j ~ N(ln j_med, sigma_j)`, `j_med = lambda sqrt(2) V_vir R_vir`, `sigma_j = 0.5`. Galaxy cut (memoryless): the fraction with `j <= j_thresh(R_gal)`, `j_thresh(R) = sqrt(G M_enc R)`, joins the galaxy; the rest goes to the ledger. Nuclear transfer (with history): each cohort keeps the running maximum of `j_thresh(R_nuc)`, `R_nuc = 100 pc` fixed, `M_enc = M_BH + M_gas,nuc + M_star,nuc` (no dark matter); a later fall of the threshold moves nothing, a later rise releases gas. `transfer_nuc` is the mass moved per step.
* **Sinks.** `Mdot_star = eps_sf M_gas / t_ff` at both scales (`eps_sf = 0.015`, `t_ff = sqrt(R^3 / 2 G M_enc)`); `Mdot_BH = min(eta_acc M_gas,nuc / t_ff, Mdot_Edd)` with `eta_acc = 0.005` and an exact strict-Eddington step (`strict_eddington_step`). Both nuclear sinks draw on the same gas and are scaled together if their demand exceeds it.
* **Feedback.** Stellar outflow `eta_w(M_halo, z) Mdot_star,tot` (`eta_w = 5 (1e11.5/M_halo)^(1/3) (9/(1+z))^(1/2)`, metal-poor limit); momentum-driven AGN outflow `f_mom [eps/(1-eps)] (c/sigma_h) Mdot_BH`, `sigma_h` the isothermal halo velocity dispersion. Driven by the sinks actually achieved, removed from both gas reservoirs in proportion to gas mass, capped at the gas present, not recycled.
* **Critical seed.** `critical_seed_stock` finds `M_seed,crit` by bisection in `ln M_seed` on `F = M_BH(z=5)/(f_BH M_star,tot(z=5)) - 1`, so `M_seed,crit = f_BH M_star,tot / G_BH` with `G_BH = M_BH(z=5)/M_seed`.

Excluded: black-hole mergers, super-Eddington growth, nuclear dark matter, an evolving `R_nuc`, torques or angular-momentum loss, delayed feedback and wind recycling.

**Merger trees for the production run.** Zhang and Hui trees from `foraois` at `dz = 0.05`, `M_res = 1e4 Msun`. That timestep is outside the practical single-split compliance regime of the builder, so the trees are not timestep-converged (see the README and `foraois` `docs/PCH08_HIGH_Z_DIAGNOSTIC.md`); the effect on the black-hole results has not been quantified.

## Numerical scheme

`run1()`/`run_forest()` (the production path) integrate the same five ODEs as `run1_scalar()` (the `solve_ivp` reference), but using closed-form/quadrature updates chosen per-equation:

- **Stellar mass and stellar metals**: not self-referential within a step (pure integrals of quantities frozen at the step start) -> exact 5-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature of `1/t_ff(z(t))` over the step.
- **Gas mass, gas metals, dust mass**: each is affine, `dy/dt = forcing - decay*y`, with forcing/decay frozen at the step midpoint redshift -> solved exactly via an exponential integrator (`_linear_ode_step`).
- **Black hole mass**: piecewise (gas-supply-limited vs. Eddington-limited, with a possible regime crossover mid-step) -> solved exactly per-regime rather than approximated.

This lets the integration vectorise across every halo in a forest simultaneously (they share a redshift grid), rather than looping per-halo with `solve_ivp`. `tests/test_run1.py` cross-validates the vectorised path against the scalar reference.
